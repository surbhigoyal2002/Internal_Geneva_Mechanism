Overview :
This project implements an Internal Geneva Mechanism, a type of indexing mechanism often used in mechanical engineering applications. The Internal Geneva Mechanism is known for its intermittent motion and precise indexing capabilities.

Introduction : 
The Internal Geneva Mechanism Project is designed to provide a simple and customizable implementation of an Internal Geneva Mechanism. This project serves as a resource for engineers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in understanding or using this mechanism in their projects.

Features : 
Configurability: Easily configure the number of slots, drive ratio, and other parameters to suit your specific requirements.
Simulation: Includes a simulation module for visualizing the movement and operation of the Internal Geneva Mechanism.
Codebase: Well-organized and documented codebase for easy understanding and modification.
